# universal install script
kewl! rmb to credit me :3   
note that this only works on *nix systems because i dont have a windows device :(  

# what is this?
this is a small template script i made that gets an executable from the latest release of a github repo and installs it in a specified directory on the user's device  

# requirements
the releases should be named (EXEC_NAME)-(ARCH)
EXEC_NAME can be specified in the script, and arch should be one of ("x86_64", "aarch64")
e.g.: scrap-x86_64 for 64 bit devices
